## **1. Definition of IoT**

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices that communicate and exchange data with each other via the internet. These devices include sensors, actuators, software, and other technologies embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to collect and share data without human intervention.

IoT enhances automation, improves efficiency, and allows remote monitoring and control of devices in various fields such as healthcare, smart homes, industrial automation, agriculture, and more.

## **2. Components of IoT**

IoT consists of several key components that enable devices to communicate and interact effectively:

### **(a) Sensors**

- Sensors are the primary data collectors in IoT systems.
- They detect physical parameters like temperature, humidity, motion, pressure, light, and sound.
- Examples:
    - Temperature sensors (DHT11, LM35)
    - Motion sensors (PIR sensor)
    - Pressure sensors (MPX5010)
    - Light sensors (LDR)

### **(b) Actuators**

- Actuators convert electrical signals into physical action.
- They receive instructions from the processing unit and perform actions like turning on a motor, adjusting a valve, or controlling a robotic arm.
- Examples:
    - Servo motors
    - Solenoid valves
    - Relays

### **(c) Network Connectivity**

- Connectivity is crucial for communication between IoT devices and systems.
- Various networking technologies enable data transmission:
    - **Wired Communication:** Ethernet, Fiber Optics
    - **Wireless Communication:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRaWAN, LTE, 5G
    - **IoT-Specific Protocols:** MQTT, CoAP, AMQP

### **(d) Cloud Computing & Data Processing**

- Cloud platforms store and process vast amounts of data collected from IoT devices.
- Cloud services provide analytics, decision-making capabilities, and remote device management.
- Examples of IoT cloud platforms:
    - AWS IoT
    - Microsoft Azure IoT
    - Google Cloud IoT
    - IBM Watson IoT

### **(e) Edge Computing**

- Edge computing processes data closer to the source rather than sending it to the cloud.
- Reduces latency and enhances real-time processing.
- Example: AI-driven cameras processing images on the device itself.

### **(f) User Interface (UI) & Applications**

- Users interact with IoT systems via mobile apps, web dashboards, or control panels.
- Enables monitoring, automation, and control of connected devices.

## **3. IoT Architecture**

IoT follows a multi-layered architecture that enables smooth functioning of the entire ecosystem. The architecture is typically divided into **four layers:**

### **(a) Perception Layer (Sensing Layer)**

- Composed of sensors, actuators, and edge devices that collect and transmit data.
- Converts physical signals into digital signals for processing.

### **(b) Network Layer**

- Responsible for data transmission between IoT devices and cloud servers.
- Uses communication protocols like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, 5G, LPWAN.

### **(c) Processing Layer (Edge/Fog Computing & Cloud Computing)**

- Handles data analysis, filtering, and decision-making.
- Uses edge devices for real-time processing and cloud servers for complex computations.

### **(d) Application Layer**

- Provides a user interface for monitoring and controlling IoT devices.
- Includes mobile applications, dashboards, and web portals.
